title: About me

My name is Max Hamstad. I am a Dedicated, passionate, and deeply focused individual currently attending Bethel University as a student-athlete for the NCAA hockey team and in pursuit of gaining a bachelor's degree in computer science. Being a student-athlete has given me many skills, including teamwork, communication, and a drive to accomplish the tasks needed to be completed. I hope to one day transfer these skills to a computer science position.
